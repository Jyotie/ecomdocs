Installation
=========================

To first begin setting up eComtics, youâ€™ll need to install the JavaScript code Snippet. Once installed, you can track, define events and activate widgets. Zero code required!

Just copy and paste the following snippet before </body> the closing tag on each page of your site. ::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://spotdy.com/spotdy-new/js/listener.js">
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript">					
	SPOTDYLIBRARY.init(["SpotDy Inc"]);
    </script>
