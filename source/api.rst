APIs
=========================

We have an extensive APIs that enables you to build smart applications. The eComtics API is build using REST. 

* Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. 
* Our APIs support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. You should never expose secret API key on a public website.
* All our APIs returns JSON as API responses, including errors.
