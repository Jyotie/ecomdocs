Analytics and Dashboards
=========================

* Template Dashboards: These are generated default dashboards
* Custom Dashboards: Created individually by the user


Dashboards
------------

By default for each company, eComtics will generate template dashboards for their e-commerce site. These dashboards cover a few Metrics and Traffic sources based on events generated on customer’s website. We have provided a brief description about each of these in the following sections. These dashboards are very standard for our clients. If our users/customers find these dashboards are not sufficient for their needs then they can create custom dashboards to fulfill their requirements, please refer to the section ‘Custom Dashboards’ for more details, or you can contact any of our personnel at eComtics for help in creating these dashboards.

Basic Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section has two dashboards one is to show basic metrics of the site like how many clicks, ProductView, add to cart events occurred. This section has another dashboard which shows the metrics per session basis. Like how many individual sessions in the last x amount of time, where x can be varied 5 min, 15 min, one day, two days, seven days or 30 days (it can even be configured to include more time periods other than existing ones).


Funnel Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dashboard currently has one panel showing the user’s actions flow. The dashboard is just to demonstrate the capability that this panel can give some insight into the flow of the user's actions on customer’s site. Like how many people are into product pages and out of these how many went ahead and added to cart and out of these how many of these moved to transaction completion. This one insight gives a holistic view of the user's actions on the site. Currently, it shows, which all users who are going from the site’s main page to the product page or main page to viewing a category of goods and number of users who are adding to cart after productview, etc.


Transaction Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dashboard mainly to show several averages of their site metrics. It helps in understanding or estimating their business on a daily basis. The metrics include average cart transaction amount which shows in the chosen period of 30 days, seven days or a day in the last 15 minutes (this time line can be configured). It also shows metrics like average cart abandonment per user indicating how many users on an average were about to purchase and then dropping their cart for whatever reasons. Then this kind of information can be used to analyze or decide to provide promotions to the revisiting/returning users who did abandon their carts in the past. There are few more such metrics of use in this dashboard.


Traffic sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It would give metrics about what kind of web browsers users are using to access the customer's website.It also provides from which sites they are navigating to the site of the client. In the sense which of their advertisements on social sites are effective would be known with these metrics.


Custom Dashboards
====================

Users can create their dashboards using our easy to use web interface. However, these dashboards are per user basis and cannot be accessible by the other users. The users need to organize their dashboards into Categories, and within each category, they can create multiple dashboards. A dashboard can have one or more panels. Each panel will show some insight/statistics about the collected events (these are the events generated from the customer’s website), or about the events produced by our machine learning lego's (machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering, predictive algorithms etc. which use the generated events from site to create new events indicating predictions or recommendations). Each dashboard once created can be saved in such a way that the whole dashboard gets refreshed and reflects the latest events.
