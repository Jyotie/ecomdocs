Analytics and Dashboards
=========================

* Template Dashboards: These are generated default dashboards

Dashboards
------------

By default for each company eComtics would generate few template dashboards for their ecommerce site. These dashboards would cover few Metrics and Traffic sources based on events generated on customer’s website. A brief description about each of these provided in the following sections. These dashboards are very common to any of our customers and if users/customers finds these dashboards are not sufficient for their needs then they can create their own dashboards to fulfil their requirements, please refer to the section ‘Custom Dashboards’ for more details or you can contact any of our personnel at SpotDy Inc for help in creating these dashboards.

Basic Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section has two dashboards one is to show basic metrics of the site like how many clicks, productview, addtocart events occurred. This section has another dashboard which shows the metrics per session basis. Like how many unique sessions in the last x amount of time, where x can be varied 5 min, 15 min, 1 day, 2 days, 7 days or 30 days (it can even be configured to include more time periods other than existing ones).


Funnel Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dashboard currently has one panel showing the user’s actions flow. This is just to demonstrate the capability that this panel can give some insight about flow of the users actions on customer’s site. Like how many people are into product pages and out of these how many went ahead and added to cart and out of these how many of these moved to transaction completion. This one insight gives holistic view of the users actions on the site. Currently it shows, which all users who are going from the site’s main page to the product page or main page to viewing a category of products or number of users who are adding to cart after productview etc.


Transaction Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dashboard mainly to show several averages of their site metrics. It helps in understanding or estimating their business on a daily basis. The metrics includes average cart transaction amount which shows in the chosen period of 30 days, 7 days or in a day in the last 15 minutes (this time line can be configured). It also shows metrics like average cart abandonment per user indicating how many users on an average were about to purchase and then dropping their cart for whatever reasons. Then this kind of information can be used to analyse or decide to provide promotions to the revisiting/returning users who did abandon their carts in the past. There are few more such metrics of use in this dashboard.


Traffic sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It would give metrics about what kind of web browsers users are using to access the customers website.It also provides from which sites they are navigating to the customer’s site. In the sense which of their advertisements on social sites are effective would be known with these metrics.
